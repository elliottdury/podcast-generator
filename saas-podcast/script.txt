Micro SaaS is the capital-efficient software business model where profitability isn't about venture-scale growth but founder-leveraged control. Think of it as bootstrapping: you build and run a narrow vertical—perhaps subscription analytics for Shopify stores or PDF watermarking for agencies—where your founding team is often you alone or a tiny core. Revenue ceilings exist but are high enough that sustainable operation matters more than chasing unicorns. The trade-off isn't speed for features but control for sustainability—you own the whole chain. This model isn't about indie hacking; it's about calculated scoping that retains full governance while returning real dividends. You keep all leverage because you built the leverage. That’s the nucleus.
